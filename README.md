dongdonghua (JJ's fork - Local Player)
===========

The master branch is the server version, and there is also a "local player" branch which can be used without the server.

I created the "local player" after adding the option to download an ASUB file to the server version.  (The "download ASUB file" option saves the word definitions along with the Chinese subtitles.)  

Note that I prefer to use the local player most of the time, and most subsequent changes/tweaking/enhancements are going to the local player.
